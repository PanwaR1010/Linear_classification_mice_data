# Linear_classification_mice_data
Some experiments were conducted on mice to see if a treatment of Downâ€™s syndrome works or not. Mice were divided into control and diseased (genotype), treated or untreated and whether it shows a particular behavior or not (treatment_behavior). Readings for 77 proteins were recorded for the mice, but some of the readings were discarded if they seemed unreliable (out of range). Your job is to develop a pre-processing pipeline and a classifier, and also find out which subset of proteins is important in predicting which class.
